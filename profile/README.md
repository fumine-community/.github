# Welcome to Fumine Community repositries

Fumine (from latin _smoke_) - student community founded in 2021 at Lipetsk
State Technical University. It's primary goal was to create educational
materials for newbyes in programming.

open-source tools, that might help to developers of all specialities and
levels: from starting developers to old ones, from web developers to embended.

## Our philosophy

Our philosophy is: good software is good software. We mostly inspired by the 
history of software from 1980's, where the one way of destibuting is hard drives

no matter how it is possible.
